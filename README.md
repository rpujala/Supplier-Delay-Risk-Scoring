# Supplier-Delay-Risk-Scoring
Machine learning system that predicts the probability of a supplier delay

# Supplier Delay Risk Scoring

* The global supply chain operations team manages hundreds of suppliers across multiple countries and shipment modes.

* Repeated supplier delays have led to SLA breaches, downstream production delays, and penalty disputes. However, planners currently react after a delay occurs.

* To proactively manage supplier risk, the team wants a **machine learning system that predicts the probability of a supplier delay** for an upcoming shipment, enabling early intervention such as expediting, rerouting, or supplier escalation.

* The model must be explainable, robust to missing data, and usable for risk-based SLA enforcement.
